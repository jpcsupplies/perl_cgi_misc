# perl_cgi_misc
Various Misc Perl CGI scripts I have created for various reasons, 
mainly price lists or for formatting plain text into a web layout theme.
Mostly to run under IIS, or xitami http on win32 platform.

Many are fairly disto neutral and may well work as is, and have been
used under Apache via Linux
